ExecutePlayerChooseAction:
	- Actions should be chosen in substates
	- enemies and players are currently handled in different systems
		- one system/substate to handle both
		- iterate through entities that are ready to choose an action
	- still use ActionBuilder for this; gonna replace it in the next step
	
Remove ExecuteActionComponent
	- just listen to the action time being < 0 holy fuck
		
ActionBuilder
	- Completely obliterate this bullshit
	- choose action stuff in substates
